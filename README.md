# Real Time Bus Tracker
This project provides a real-time bus tracker for currently active Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) buses on Route 1, built from MIT xPro starter code. Data is fetched from the MBTA v3 API, and is refreshed every 10 seconds. The datapoints provided include: total currently active buses as well as the current stop and occupancy level for each active bus, displayed on a map.

### How to run: 
- Click the button at the top left of the screen to begin the real-time data feed
- Click the pause button at any time to pause the refresh

### Roadmap: 
- Allow user to change routes via a dropdown menu
- Connect the "current stop" integer code to a plain English stop name    
- Improve label positioning for bus icons on map so that image and text are visibly separated
- Allow user to select different datapoints to view for currently active buses
